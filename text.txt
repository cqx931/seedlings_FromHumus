
            When the language
             underneath our

         words starts to fold or

                       rot, we get
                    meaning compost.

                The peels,
                    fabrications,
                             and seeds of
            hypothesis we discard,
                                 break
         down into microcosmic games, elastic combinations of waves.



      None of the unconscious we spit out when we speak
      disappears.
 Autonomous products and particles of the mind follow

               a cycle
               like water, and sunlight, and every other
               fruit of the Earth.


Earthworms come to reclaim every sentence,
fungi grow over everything our senses touch.

Earthquakes are nothing
for sugarcane ghosts.

They sit still through the movements
and write conjurations:

Water children are casting dreams. Or:

Lines on the land hurt like
butcher marks on live animals.

Purificatory baths won’t serve
as explanations. Or:

Compassion stones, don’t emigrate.

Harvesting flowers is still plausible;
we’ve planted riddles like seeds.

Money may stops herbs from
walking up and down the continents
but not from the pursuit of
breaking through concrete sidewalks, bursting
open empty treasure homes.

Arousing the discoveries of vanity, they desire everybody.

Who are they? Never been to the regions where the winds sprout, wasps caress them as they walk about the country.

Did they sit in front of the TV, mindless, stringing thoughts for the crows, kissing knives, feeling superstitious of frogs, of dresses, of eggs, of fluids?

The transition was vulnerability and softness, submission to the eroticization of effeminate mannerisms, a swallowing of the generosity of strangers. To speak of envy of the artifacts of hormones or to fixate on surgeries would be a perverse objectification.

They will miss the lesbian propositioning, the cisgender avoidances, the pleasurable disgust at physiology.

Now they undress guided by the drive of piloerection, to the thought of osmolality, and touch.

They side with potatoes, peppers, and other independent thinkers and sorters, uprooting the death warnings that suck the crickets out of our blood.

There’s a new theory of paranoia, as indicated in the diagrams: To please is to seduce a neurosis, to touch your own cranium sponge, to measure the distance from your oculomotor nerve to your olfactory stria. At six in the morning pupils are nothing but undulating patterns of dust. It isn’t ontology, just incubators for existential thoughts on the sociocultural structures of consciousness. Something to mitigate the desires of the quintessentially moody kernels of truth we loan as performance. Commitment to the ludicrous paradoxes of humor, to the guts viciously pressured by the ink of the tattoos, to the castration anxieties and their redemption by a dominatrix. It goes against all sublimated grumblings on how homemaking or biological extinction would unleash some garish psychic operations.

How come we manage to
                     grow in all
                                directions and still
                                                    have plenty of everywheres around us
                            to be in,
bottomless vanishing points
                          to be alone in, to remember
                                                    there are folds between us and the other images that grow,

the combinations of sounds that encode
                                     common beliefs, the drops of water
                                                                      sliding down windows, the yellow leaves
                                                                                                            responding to the wind with a switch in points of view.


Did we go off thinking
                     we knew ourselves, did we
                                              come back translated, are we
                                                                          working yet on telling hogs a fortune, collaborating with fellow lumps of glass to cook
                                  dishes better than what we’ve been getting,
                         befriending the birds,
                                           harvesting the salts,
                                                           placing onions under our beds.

The moon found them pouring scalding water through an incision

Where before a kindly constellation, an abandoned planet with miscellany habits
now nothing but a carcass; arteries haphazardly parboiled.


Nearby insects wore a veil of skin and ashes, unwanted entrails and fibers lay there
like an abandoned house.


Perhaps the animal should have emigrated to another planet, one
where the atmosphere may help one believe with conviction in mold, and sage, and death.


Not this one where evidence funerals and dirt could mean
nothing to them.
