

            When the language

             underneath our

         words starts to fold or

                       rot we get

                    meaning compost.

                The peels          
                             and seeds of
            hypothesis we discard
                                 break
         down 
             into microcosmic games, elastic 
             combinations of waves.


      None of the unconscious we spit out when we speak

      disappears. Autonomous products of the mind follow

               a cycle
               like water, and sunlight, and every other
               fruit of the Earth.


Earthworms will come to reclaim every sentence

fungi will grow over everything our senses touch.

Earthquakes are nothing

for sugarcane ghosts

sit still through the movement

and write conjurations:

Water children are casting dreams

lines on the land hurt like
butcher marks on live animals.

Money may stop herbs from

walking up and down the continent

but not from the pursuit of

breaking through concrete sidewalks, bursting

open empty treasure homes.

Purificatory baths won’t serve
as explanation. Harvesting flowers 
is still plausible; we’ve planted 
compassion riddles like seeds.

Arousing the discoveries of vanity, desire.
Who are they? Never been to the regions where the wind sprouts, wasps caress them as they walk about the country
as they sit in front of the TV, mindless, stringing thoughts for the crows, kissing knives, feeling superstitious 
of eggs, of dresses, of fluids, of frogs.

The transition is vulnerability and softness, submission to the eroticization and the mannerisms
a swallowing of the generosity of strangers. To speak of envy of the artifacts 
of hormones or to fixate on surgeries would be a perverse objectification.

They will miss the cisgender avoidances, the pleasurable disgust at physiology
undressing guided by the drive of piloerection, to the thought of osmolality, and touch.

But they side with stones, and peppers, and other independent thinkers and sorters
uprooting the death warnings, the crickets out of our blood.

There’s a new theory of paranoia: To please is to seduce a neurosis, to measure the distance 
from your oculomotor nerve to my olfactory stria. At six in the morning pupils are nothing 
but undulating patterns of dust. It isn’t ontology, just incubators for existential thoughts 
and structures of consciousness. Something to mitigate the moody desires of the  kernels of 
truth we loan as performance. Commitment to the ludicrous paradoxes of humor, to the guts 
viciously pressured by the ink of the tattoos. Biological extinction would unleash some garish 
psychic operations.

We have managed to
               grow in all
                         directions and still have plenty 
                                                        of everywhere to be in,
bottomless vanishing points
                          to be alone in, to remember
                                                    the folds between us 
                                                                        and the other images that grow
the combinations of sounds that encode
                                     common beliefs
                                                  the drops of water
                                                                   sliding down windows
                                                                                      the yellow leaves
                                                                                                      responding to the wind 
                                                                                                                          with a switch
                                                                                                                                    in point of view.
We went off thinking
               we knew ourselves
                               came back translated
                                                  working yet 
                                                            on telling fortunes
                                                                               collaborating 
                                                                                           
with fellow lumps 
                of glass to cook
                              dishes better 
                                         than what we’ve been getting
                                                                    befriending the birds
                                                                                      harvesting the salts
                                                                                                         placing an onion 
                                                                                                                        under our beds.

The moon found them pouring scalding water through an incision
in the intestinal membrane.


Where before a kindly constellation, an abandoned planet with miscellany habits

now nothing but a carcass; arteries haphazardly parboiled.


Nearby insects wore a veil of skin and ashes, unwanted entrails and fibers lay there

like an abandoned house.


Perhaps the animal should have emigrated to another planet, one

where the atmosphere may help one believe with conviction in mold, and sage, and death.


Not this one where evidence funerals and dirt could mean

nothing to them.
